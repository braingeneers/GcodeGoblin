# GcodeGoblin

GcodeGoblin is a small python script for post-processing G-Code. 

It provides the following post-processing commands (Note that the semicolon (;) is the G-Code commend indicator):

- `; START_COPY: <buffer-name>`: Starts to copy the following lines into a named buffer
- `; STOP_COPY`: End of the copying
- `; PASTE: <buffer-name>`: Pastes the named buffer here
- `; START_CUT`: Suppresses the following lines
- `; STOP_CUT`: prints the following lines.

The tool works on both `.3mf` files as generated by the Bambu and Orca slicer (it recaclucates the required checksum
file also), and it also works on plain `.gcode` files.
