# GcodeGoblin

GcodeGoblin is a small python script for post-processing G-Code. 

It provides the following post-processing commands (Note that the semicolon (;) is the G-Code commend indicator):

- `; START_COPY: <buffer-name>`: Starts to copy the following lines into a named buffer
- `; STOP_COPY`: End of the copying
- `; PASTE: <buffer-name>`: Pastes the named buffer here
- `; START_CUT`: Suppresses the following lines
- `; STOP_CUT`: prints the following lines.

The tool works on both `.3mf` files as generated by the Bambu and Orca slicer (it recaclucates the required checksum
file also), and it also works on plain `.gcode` files.

**Note:** as of September 2024, the `Others -> Post-processing scripts` feature in Bambu and Orca slicer appears not to
work.


## Example

```gcode
;; filename: example.gcode
G1
; START_COPY: A
G2
; STOP_COPY
G3
; START_CUT
G4
; STOP_CUT
G5
; PASTE: A
```

running `python gcodegoblin.py example.gcode`
should yield 

```gcode
;; filename: example.fixed.gcode
G1
; START_COPY: A
; starting to copy into buffer A
G2
; STOP_COPY: A
; stopping copy into buffer A
G3
; START_CUT
; CUT START
; CUT STOPPED
G5
; PASTE: A
; pasting from buffer A into output:
G2
; END OF PASTE BUFFER
```
